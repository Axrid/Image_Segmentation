__Update 03-06-2017__:   __There're some programs of image segmentation written by myself, and still in a modified state.__

## Overview


Completed with Tensorflow, in Python2.7.

Including: FCN(8/16/32), SegNet.

## Usage 

- Use ```cd FCN/``` to find code files.
- Run ```run.sh``` to generated the image you need.

## Requirements

   * Python2.7

   * Tensorflow-gpu
