# Image Segmentation
 
__Update 03-06-2017__:   __There're some programs of image segmentation written by myself, and still in a modified state.__

## Introduction


Completed with Caffe and Tensorflow, in Python2.7.

Including: FCN(8/16/32), SegNet.

## Usage 

* run "cd FCN/" to find code files 
* run "run.sh" to generated the image you need

## Requirements

   * Python2.7

   * Tensorflow-gpu
